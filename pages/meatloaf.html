    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Topped with a sweet sauce, this traditional meat loaf recipe tastes so good that you might want to double it so everyone can have seconds. It also freezes well.
    </p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices bread</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2/3 cup 2% milk</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>/2 cup finely shredded carrot</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1-1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        </ul>    
        Glaze:
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared mustard</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <p>
     
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350째. Tear bread into 2-inch pieces; place in a blender. Cover and pulse to form coarse crumbs; transfer to a large bowl. Stir in egg, milk, cheese, onion, carrot, salt and pepper. Add beef; mix lightly but thoroughly. Transfer to a greased 9x5-in. loaf pan. </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix glaze ingredients; spread over loaf. Bake 60-75 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160째. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
                Freeze option: Bake meat loaf without glaze. Securely wrap cooled meat loaf in foil, then freeze. To use, partially thaw meat loaf in refrigerator overnight. Prepare and spread glaze over top; reheat on a greased shallow baking pan in a preheated 350째 oven until heated through and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165째. </li>
        </ol>
