    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
       <ul>
           <li>ground beef</li>
           <li>sausage</li>
           <li>garlic</li>
           <li>tomatoes</li>
           <li>tomato paste</li>
           <li>parsley</li>
           <li>basil</li>
           <li>salt</li>
           <li>cottage cheese</li>
           <li>beaten eggs</li>
           <li>grated Parmesan</li>
           <li>olive oil</li>
           <li>lasagna noodles</li>
           <li>mozzarella</li>
       </ul> 
   </p>
   <h4>Directions</h4> 
   <p>
        <oL>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain. </li>
            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
